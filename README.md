# Kronecker-based-CS-recovery  -- RosNaviGator


## Fork to study and to port to python (if I manage) the work of https://github.com/hadizand/Kronecker-based-CS-recovery

### Branches:
#### master
I will freely modify the code here to both test the pre-existing implementation (MATLAB), but also to port it to python for a project I'm working on.

Files:
- kronecker.ipynb:
     - python implementation

Directories:
- debugMatlab: 
     - modified version of original hadizand's code (MATLAB) with many debug prints to understand what happens at each step
     - added different files trying to understand and repeat the creation of wavelet dictionaries as performed in MATLAB through __wmpdictionary__

- hadizandMatlab:
     - original hadizand's code (MATLAB) without all the debug prints and added functions, just to clean test the hadizand implementation

## Original description
Kronecker technique for improving quality of the signal in compressive sensing recovery

 This code shows the effect of Kronecker technique on compressive sensing recovery; this technique has been used for different signals and measurement matrices, 
  and it has been published in multiple journals and conference papers:

%-----------The main objective of this approach
% For fast and efficient compression, sensing phase in compressive sensing can be done in very small size, because in this case: 
    %it requires very small measurement matrix, 
    %less number of multiplication and addition operations, and
    %less delay for generating compressed samples
    % which can be used for sensors with low computational resources.
 But sensing in small size degrades quality of recovery. Kronecker
 technique can be used in order to improve the quality of recovered signal.

%---------------------------------------CS Recovery algorithm
 Any recovery algorithm can be used. In this code, Sl0 which is very fast CS recovery algorithm is used.

%----------------------------------Database
 In this code, an ECG signal from MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database which is public dataset is used.
