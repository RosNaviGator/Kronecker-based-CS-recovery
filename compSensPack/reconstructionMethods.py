def SL0(y, A, sigma_min, sigma_decrease_factor=0.5, mu_0=2, L=3, A_pinv=None, showProgress=False):
    """
    Returns the sparsest vector `s` that satisfies the underdetermined system of 
    linear equations `A @ s = y`, using the Smoothed L0 (SL0) algorithm.

    Requires:
    --------
    - numpy as np
    

    Parameters:
    ----------
    y : numpy array
        The observed vector (Mx1), where M is the number of rows in `A`.
    
    A : numpy array
        The measurement matrix (MxN), which should be 'wide', meaning it has more 
        columns than rows (N > M). The number of rows in `A` must match the length 
        of `y`.
    
    sigma_min : float
        The minimum value of `sigma`, which determines the stopping criterion for 
        the algorithm. It should be chosen based on the noise level or desired 
        accuracy.
    
    sigma_decrease_factor : float, optional (default=0.5)
        The factor by which `sigma` is decreased in each iteration. This should be 
        a positive value less than 1. Smaller values lead to quicker reduction of 
        `sigma`, possibly at the cost of accuracy for less sparse signals.
    
    mu_0 : float, optional (default=2)
        The scaling factor for `mu`, where `mu = mu_0 * sigma^2`. This parameter 
        influences the convergence rate of the algorithm.
    
    L : int, optional (default=3)
        The number of iterations for the inner loop (steepest descent). Increasing 
        `L` can improve the precision of the result but also increases computational 
        cost.
    
    A_pinv : numpy array, optional
        The precomputed pseudoinverse of the matrix `A`. If not provided, it will be 
        calculated within the function as `np.linalg.pinv(A)`. Providing this value 
        is beneficial if the function is called repeatedly with the same `A`.
    
    showProgress : bool, optional (default=False)
        If `True`, the function prints the current value of `sigma` during each 
        iteration, which helps monitor the convergence process.

    Returns:
    -------
    s : numpy array
        The estimated sparse signal (Nx1) that best satisfies the equation `A @ s = y`.

    Notes:
    -----
    - The algorithm works by iteratively reducing `sigma` in a geometric sequence, 
      starting with `sigma = 2 * max(abs(s))` and ending with `sigma_min`. At each 
      step, the function adjusts `s` to minimize the L0-norm by smoothing it using 
      a Gaussian kernel.
    
    - The choice of `sigma_min` is crucial: for noiseless cases, a smaller `sigma_min` 
      yields a sparser solution; for noisy cases, `sigma_min` should be a few times 
      the standard deviation of the noise in `s`.

    - If `A_pinv` is precomputed and passed as an argument, the function becomes 
      more efficient, especially in scenarios where it is called repeatedly with the 
      same `A`.
